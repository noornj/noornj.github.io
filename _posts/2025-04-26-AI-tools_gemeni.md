## Thoughts ... Thinking out loud

I had just seen the generative AI capabilities published by Google via using their new amazing Gemini 2.5 module. I had recently created an excel sheet using google drive - sheets that would calculate the gold price as I've interest in investing in real Gold as prices fluctuate. As a result, I decided to re-write my excel sheet logic and calucation into a single page application without writing a piece of code. Knowadays called vibe coding, I guess!. 

I was amazed at the speed and pace of the Gemini 2.5 and to my surprise the application is fully functional and live. 



Here's the first glimpse on the application and how it looks:

 #### Features
 It's integrated with a live API to get the current global gold prices! 

```Gold estimator``` is fast deciding factor when dealing with local goldsmith in Iraq, it gives the gram prices to navigate through their prices and and bargen to reduce their prices.  

> #### Prompts used
> 1- I will publish the prompts used once I finalize the tool 


after the prompts and couple of tweaking using Gemini generative AI tweaking, I was able to publish the tool
