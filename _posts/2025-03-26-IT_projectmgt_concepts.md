## IBM Project Management
## Project vs Project management

Project purpose: achieve an objective and prodcue measurable value. 

Project management purpose: Control how goals are archieved.

```Project management``` is about estimating and controlling six constraints: 
1- scope
2- schedule
3- financials
4- risk
5- quality
6- resources. 

The ```workflow``` is basically the deveopment - testing - deveopment cycle.

> #### Misconceptions
> 1- a good project manager doesn't bite off more than they can chew. 
> 2- project manager doesn't have to be the expert & not the expert. 


### Project management summary:
1- Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, and tools to a project to deliver intended outcomes and produce value. It has many benefits, including managing budgets and timelines, improving productivity, addressing project risks, improving communication, and increasing customer satisfaction.

2- Project management seeks to control the scope, schedule, financials, risk, quality, and resources of a project.

3- Successful project management keeps projects within budget and on time, provides needed tools to the team, clarifies responsibilities, facilitates communication, manages delivery and risk, drives quality, and monitors and reports results

4- The three primary levers that project managers drive include time, quality, and resources.

5- A project is an endeavor that is unique, temporary, completable, and measurable, while a program is a collection of projects that is large, long-term, general, and strategic projects. A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs that is ongoing and aligns with the organization’s strategic objectives.

6- Common project management resources that can be used to learn more about project management include the Project Management Body of Knowledge, or PMBOK.

### Adaptive project management models
These models, which are more adaptable and flexible, include:

1- Agile
>
    In an Agile project management model, a project is carried out in iterations using sprints, 
    which are typically week-long, as opposed to long and rigid project phases, 
    as followed in Waterfall. Weekly processing of design decisions, 
    implementation decisions, prototypes, and client feedback allows the end user to be more 
    involved in the design process and enables the team to react swiftly if necessary.

#### Agile: Core values

The original Agile Manifesto identified four core values that govern Agile. These include:

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

* Working software over comprehensive documentation

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

* Responding to change over following a plan


2- Scrum

built to work in sprints, making it agile and adaptable. One significant difference is that Scrum has clearly defined Scrum roles.

```Scrum roles```
Some of the roles include:

A Scrum master 

A Scrum product owner

A Scrum team

A ```Scrum Master``` is primarily a project manager. This role involves managing the project in accordance with Scrum processes and guidelines. The key responsibility of this role is to remove roadblocks for the project team.

A ```Scrum product``` owner represents the voice of the customer for the team. The owner establishes priorities for the product backlog and ensures that the project achieves a high return on investment (ROI).

A ```Scrum team``` consists of members who have the technical expertise to contribute to a project. They work toward delivering the project on time and with quality.



3- Six Sigma Method
>
Overall, the Six Sigma method is data driven. Data accuracy is required. 
It is a system of systematically identifying errors and providing methods to eliminate them.
>

4- Lean
>
Lean means delivering value while minimizing waste.
Lean, frequently associated with Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing,
 aims to align production with demand by emphasizing productivity, efficiency, and waste reduction.
>

5- Kanban "“visual board.”"
>
The key feature of the Kanban model is real-time communication about capacity and complete transparency related to work.

## Project Managenment Models and Methodologies

The ```Stacey Diagram``` analysis tool allows decision makers to determine the best approach to planning and executing a project. This analysis is based on two parameters

 1- Level of Agreement: Agreement scoring normally is an indicator of how much change you can anticipate. The less agreement you have, the more change can be anticipated. Agreement scores and complexity can impact the delivery cycles. In most cases, low agreement and high complexity levels normally lead to the need to deliver more frequently to ensure you are meeting project objectives.

2- Technology Complexity: Technology complexity is an indicator of the level of innovation that will be needed to plan and execute the project. Evaluation ranges span known technology to totally new and unknown technology.

Here's the example sheet we've used to demonstrate and practice the knowledge:

```Agile:``` A flexible, collaborative approach to project management emphasizing adaptability, customer feedback, and continuous improvement.

```Predictive (Waterfall):``` A linear, plan-driven process where all requirements are defined upfront, and phases are completed sequentially.


```Iterative:``` Repeating cycles of planning, execution, and refinement to gradually improve the product.


```Incremental:``` Developing the product in small, functional pieces (increments) that add up to the final system, allowing early delivery and feedback.

## 12 Principles of Project Management

1. **Stewardship**  
    being a diligent, respectful, and caring steward
2. **Collaborative team**  
    creating a collaborative project team environment.
3. **Stakeholder engagement**  
    effectively engaging with stakeholders.
4. **Value creation**  
   
5. **Systems thinking**  
    recognizing, evaluating, and responding to system interactions.
6. **Leadership behavior**  

7. **Tailoring**  

8. **Quality**  
    building quality into processes and deliverables
9. **Complexity navigation**  

10. **Risk response optimization**  

11. **Adaptability and resiliency**  

12. **Change facilitation**
